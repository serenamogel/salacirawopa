He was born on May 29, 1984, to Mary Anthony and Carmelo Iriarte. Anthony was the third overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft.?</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1193643233.jpg><p><span>Anthony?s parents moved to Baltimore before his teenage years, which allowed him to gain more exposure in basketball. He attended two different high schools, one being the Towson Catholic where he played for three years.?</span></p><p><span>The Brooklyn native reached a tremendous height by his junior year and attracted several scouts with his impeccable talent. Anthony?s mother transferred him to Oak Hill Academy in Virginia for his senior year.?</span></p><p><span>After getting off to a 67-0 win streak with Oak Hill, Anthony finally faced defeat against a <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>LeBron James</a>-led St. Vincent-St. Mary high-school. The Oak Hill forward was one of the top-rated recruits coming out of high-school and had the option to forego college and join the NBA.</span></p><p><span>Despite being eligible to enter the league, Carmelo Anthony decided to attend one year at Syracuse for more experience. The Syracuse Orange went on to win the NCAA championship in Anthony?s freshman season, and he averaged 22.2 points during the championship run.?</span></p><p><span>As for his personal life, Carmelo Anthony got engaged to La La Anthony in 2004. The couple tied the knot in 2010, three years after the birth of their son Kiyan.?</span></p><p><span>Their relationship suffered rocky instances late in the 2010s and both parties mutually agreed for a divorce, but La La and Melo seem to be back together for good.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Carmelo Anthony NBA Career</b></h2><p><span>Anthony initially wanted to play at Syracuse for a longer period, but felt the need to leave after winning the championship as a freshman. He set out on a new endeavor, and the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Denver Nuggets</a> used their third overall pick to select Melo in the 2003 NBA Draft.?</span></p><p><span>He made his debut against the San Antonio Spurs and averaged an impressive 21.0 points per game as a rookie. Anthony finished second in the Rookie of the Year voting behind LeBron James and replicated similar form in the subsequent seasons as well.?</span></p><p><span>He played with the Nuggets for eight years and registered several iconic moments with them. He reached his prime during the late 2000s and notched up 30 point games for fun. After posting incredible numbers in Denver and averaged 24.8 PPG in eight seasons, Anthony was then traded to the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>New York Knicks</a> in 2011.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20210120231745/2021-01-02T060003Z_473873404_MT1USATODAY15387338_RTRMADP_3_NBA-PORTLAND-TRAIL-BLAZERS-AT-GOLDEN-STATE-WARRIORS.jpg><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Trouble with the Knicks and career resurrection?</b></h2><p><span>Melo to the Knicks was a dreamy move, and fans in New York went crazy about him joining their franchise. He had developed as one of the league?s best players by that time, but collective success was hard to come by for the team.?</span></p><p><span>Melo averaged 24.7 points and 2.4 blocks per game in seven seasons with the Knicks and had a fallout with Phil Jackson, who the President of the franchise at that period. Jackson wasn?t keen on keeping Anthony as he felt the forward didn?t fit well in his offensive plans.?</span></p><p><span>Thus, Anthony was consequently sent to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>OKC</a> when he played for a year. Melo?s career took a sharp downward spike after his Knicks exit, and the 'superstar' status soon left his name after a dip in scoring averages.?</span></p><p><span>He then joined the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Houston Rockets</a> after one year in Oklahoma, a move that put a dark dent in Melo?s career. He just played ten games for the Rockets as the team snubbed him without releasing his contract.?</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20210120231934/2021-01-08T034716Z_1072676526_MT1USATODAY15408527_RTRMADP_3_NBA-MINNESOTA-TIMBERWOLVES-AT-PORTLAND-TRAIL-BLAZERS.jpg><p><span>The Rockets then traded Melo to the Blazers in 2019, where he found a beam of shining light once again.</span></p><p><span>Though age caught up, Melo was able to perform at a challenging level in Portland. His veteran experience proved to be the perfect match for the team?s young core.?</span></p><p>After acting as the spark plug off of the bench, the Trail Blazers were not willing to take back the veteran forward to the team. But Melo had a special team waiting for him in the off-season, close friend LeBron James' Lakers.</p><p>The Purple and Gold who have been on a roll of signing veterans, brought up Melo as they needed shooting in their team. Given that the 2021-22 season will be the first time LBJ and Melo will play with each other, fans simply can't wait to see the duo this season.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Major Achievements?</b></h2><p><span>10?
