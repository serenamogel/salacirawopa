The 17-year-old Californian comedian currently has 1.7 million Instagram followers in addition to 9.1 million TikTok followers.</strong></p><p>Keemokazi began his career in show business as an actor and vocalist. He performed in a few The Last Ship episodes as an actor. Keemokazi chose to give up acting because his major love was music. The most popular songs by Keemokazi are Foreign, Feel, and New Kid.</p><h2><span id=Keemokazi_focused_more_on_TikTok_to_increase_his_music_fan_base>Keemokazi focused more on TikTok to increase his music fan base</span></h2><p>Midway through <strong>2017</strong>, Keemokazi launched his music career. He was seen more, but he didn’t hit as hard as he had hoped. Keemokazi kept on recording music, but he had trouble expanding his fan base.</p><p>Keemokazi gained thousands of followers with his debut TikTok videos, but he wasn’t reliable with his uploads. After observing how other content producers gained millions of followers by producing original content and maintaining consistency, he decided to devote greater attention to TikTok. Keemokazi viewed TikTok as a way to increase his popularity and fan base for his songs. In a recent Q&A video, he disclosed:</p><p>I understood I had to take advantage of TikTok as a strategy to increase my fan base and following. I observed several haphazard individuals going bonkers and drastically increasing their TikTok followings. As a result, I said, “I need to get on TikTok and decide what I’m going to do. I did it, and I don’t regret it, people.”</p><p>Over the past few months, Keemokazi has grown rapidly on TikTok. He had 4 million followers in April, and now, three and a half months later, he has 9.1 million. This quick development can be due to Keemokazi’s dependability and comic timing. In an interview with Talent Resources, Keemokazi stated:</p><p>“Before my pranks became popular, I produced several unrelated videos that fared reasonably well, but I soon discovered that what I do best is make people laugh. Observing what’s popular and giving it your spin is another technique to make your videos popular. Your strongest quality is your personality.</p><p>His success on TikTok has helped Keemokazi’s music. His debut album was scheduled to be released in June 2020, but he appears to have moved up the release date. The poignant track, Special, is Keemokazi’s most recent offering.</p><h3><span id=Keemokazi8217s_mother_enjoys_watching_his_videos_despite_her_harsh_responses_to_his_jokes>Keemokazi’s mother enjoys watching his videos despite her harsh responses to his jokes</span></h3><p>The practical jokes that Keemokazi plays on his parents and five sisters are his most well-liked content. The main source of humor in Keemokazi’s writing comes from his family’s responses.</p><p>Although Keemokazi’s mother, Nina Hazem, initially seems furious over the jokes, it turns out that she laughs with Keemokazi after the video gets viral.</p><p>In the Q&A, Keemokazi said, “She’s really unhappy when I play the prank on her, but after she watches the video, she laughs. “She is a mother; can’t be angry with her son incessantly. She becomes irate, but in the end, you must pardon your lovely son.</p><p>Nina has become more well-known online as a result of Keemokazi’s films. She presently has 266K Instagram followers and identifies as a TikTok mom.</p><h3><span id=Keemokazi_has_demonstrated_his_willingness_to_use_his_position_for_advocacy>Keemokazi has demonstrated his willingness to use his position for advocacy</span></h3><p>He expressed his support for the Black Lives Matter movement on social media, like many other prominent users. Keemokazi, though, took it a step further and created a song in favor of the cause.</p><p>On <strong>June 5th, 2020</strong>, Keemokazi uploaded a portion of his I’m Not Black video to Instagram with the caption:</p><p>“When you see something unusual, it’s time to make a change and take action. Nothing would make me happier than to use my words to convey a message. I HOPE this doesn’t offend anyone because real-life catastrophes are much more shocking than this video. We must continue, in any way we can, to FIGHT FOR CHANGE.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>What Is The Real Name Of Youtuber CoryxKenshin</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>TIKTOKER</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Izzy.tube</a></h3>Izzy.tube, also known as Ezzaddin is a Yemeni TikToker and social media celebrity.
