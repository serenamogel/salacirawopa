Nameko employs research-based approaches to combat cancer. She gave an interview to Russia 1 (the state-owned television station). <strong>Her net worth is believed to be between</strong><b> $10 million as of November 2023. </b>She spoke about taking the initial step into the world of business.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Vorontsova earned her bachelor’s degree in biology from Saint Petersburg State University and her medical degree from Moscow State University in 2011. She was a Ph.D. candidate at the Endocrinology Research Centre in Moscow, which is directed by Dedov and administers the charity initiative Alfa-Endo for children with endocrine illnesses, with Ivan Ivanovich Dedov as her adviser. Alfa-Endo is backed by the Alfa Group’s Alfa-Bank, led by Petr Aven and Mikhail Fridman.</p><p>Vorontsova co-authored five articles between 2013 and 2015, including “The state of blood antioxidant system in individuals with active acromegaly.” She also co-wrote a book regarding idiopathic stunting in children in 2015. Vorontsova is acknowledged as being Putin’s genetic engineering adviser, particularly in using CRISPR to make genetically-engineered kids.</p><h2>Maria Vorontsova Husband & Marriage</h2><p><b>Who is Maria Vorontsova’s husband? </b>Maria Vorontsova is a happily married woman. Jorrit Faassen, her kind and caring spouse, is her husband. Jorrit is a wealthy businessman who rose to prominence after marrying President Vladimir Putin’s oldest daughter. He was assaulted by four bodyguards belonging to Russian financier Matvey Urin, co-owner of Trado-Bank, in November 2010. The co-owner formerly ran another bank named Breeze Bank and was connected to four other Moscow banks. Urin was taken from his employment and eventually imprisoned in Butyrka after a half-hour incident.</p><p>Not only that but he was obliged to give up all of his property, including his large holding. Maria and Jorrit Faassen lived in a penthouse atop a residential building in Voorschoten, the Netherlands. However, following the alleged instance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 being shot down by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, Dutch people called for Vorontsova’s expulsion from the nation in 2014. The couple was said to be residing in Moscow in 2015.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqqZlnq3u9Gopa2rn6uucA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./renee-lamanna-missing-update-unsolved-mysteries.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Renee Lamanna Missing Update: Unsolved Mysteries Trending">&larr;
