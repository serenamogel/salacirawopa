His legacy was so large that it was almost impossible for someone to come in and take his place. As the leadership changed hands from Phil to his son Willie, many were not so sure about it. But over the years, Willie has taken on all the challenges that were set out to him and has surpassed the expectations of many. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Willie Robertson.</p><p><strong>Willie Robertson is an American TV personality, businessman, author, active outdoorsman, speaker and news contributor.&nbsp;He is best known for his appearances on the reality TV series&nbsp;Duck Dynasty&nbsp;on A&E, which followed his family’s duck call business,&nbsp;Duck Commander, of which he is the current CEO.&nbsp;He is also the executive producer of&nbsp;Buck Commander, another hunting-related show on the Outdoor Channel.&nbsp;He lives in West Monroe, Louisiana with his wife <a href=#>Korie </a>and his six children: <a href=#>John Luke</a>, <a href=#>Sadie</a>, <a href=#>Will</a>, Rowdy, <a href=#>Bella</a>, and <a href=#>Rebecca</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Willie-Robertson.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>Willie Robertson’s net worth is estimated to be around&nbsp;$45 million&nbsp;as of May 2023. Willie Robertson’s main source of income is from being the&nbsp;CEO of Duck Commander, which is a company that sells duck calls and other hunting gear. He also earns money from being the&nbsp;executive producer and star of Duck Dynasty, which was a reality TV series that aired on A&E from 2012 to 2017.&nbsp;Additionally, he owns other businesses such as&nbsp;Buck Commander, which is a subsidiary of Duck Commander that sells deer hunting products,&nbsp;and Willie’s Duck Diner, which is a restaurant that serves Southern cuisine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Willie Jess Robertson was born on the 22nd of April 1972 to Phil and Marsha Kay Robertson. The third child of the pair, Willie has two older brothers, Alan and Jase, one younger sister, Phyllis, and one younger brother, Jep. Like his father, Willie was into hunting from a young age and accompanied his father to the winds. Of all the Robertson children, Willie was the one who was most interested in the family business and spent a considerable amount of time learning about duck calling and hunting. After graduating from a local high school, Willie enrolled at Harding University but transferred to NE Louisiana University, at a later date. He graduated in 2014, with a business degree.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career:</h2><p>Right after graduating from University, Will made the trip back to his hometown and began assisting his father in running the business. His business degree proved to be an asset to the company, and Phil left the leadership position to his son. After taking over his father, Will expanded the family business from a living room operation to a multi-million-dollar enterprise and destination for all things outdoors. This growth helped the Robertsons to secure a reality TV show, Duck Dynasty.</p><p>While Will is most known as the CEO of the Duck Commander, he is also the founder and CEO of a subsidiary company Buck Commander. The company is also at the center of a reality TV series under the same name produced by Under Armour on the Outdoor Channel. In the longlist of his business ventures, Willie also allows visits to his museum which is a museum in West Monroe, Louisiana under “Duck Commander The Tour.”</p><p>His other business <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">includes</a> 4 Bears Music Group, Robertson Brothers Farm, WK Properties, Back 40 Properties, Commander Services Co, Commerce Street Holdings, WKR Investments, and more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Television:</h2><p>Over the years, Will appeared on several television shows related to his family business and his personal beliefs.

Will also appeared in the series Buck Commander from 2010 to the present.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>He has also made cameo <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appearances </a>on other shows, such as&nbsp;Last Man Standing&nbsp;and the Christian film&nbsp;God’s Not Dead, with his wife.&nbsp;He has also been a guest of United States Representative Vance McAllister at the 2014 State of the Union Address by President Barack Obama.&nbsp;He has also been interviewed by Conan O’Brien on his show&nbsp;CONAN.&nbsp;He has also produced a Christian Broadway-style play called&nbsp;His Story.</p><p>Here is a table of content for Willie Robertson’s television career and appearances with facts and values:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Title</th><th>Role</th><th>Year</th><th>Fact</th><th>Value</th></tr><tbody readability=19><tr readability=9><td>Duck Dynasty</td><td>Reality cast member</td><td>2012-2017</td><td>The show follows the lives of the Robertson family, who became successful from their family-operated business, Duck Commander</td><td>The show was one of the most-watched nonfiction cable series in history, with a record-breaking 11.8 million viewers for its fourth-season premiere</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Buck Commander Protected by Under Armour</td><td>Executive producer and host</td><td>2010-present</td><td>The show features Willie and his friends hunting for deer and other big game</td><td>The show airs on the Outdoor Channel and has spawned a series of DVDs and merchandise</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>God’s Not Dead</td><td>Actor (cameo)</td><td>2014</td><td>Willie and his wife Korie play themselves in the Christian film, where they are interviewed by a reporter about their faith and their show</td><td>The film was a surprise hit at the box office, grossing over $60 million on a $2 million budget.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Last Man Standing</td><td>Actor (guest star)</td><td>2013</td><td>Willie and his uncle Si appear as themselves in the sitcom, where they meet Mike Baxter (Tim Allen) at a hunting store</td><td>The episode was watched by 8.5 million viewers and received positive reviews from critics</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>At Home With the Robertsons</td><td>Host (with Korie)</td><td>2021</td><td>Willie and Korie invite celebrities and influencers to their Louisiana home to discuss various topics and share their perspectives3</td><td>The show is a Facebook Watch original series that premiered on April 5, 2021</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Authorship:</h2><p>In addition to being a businessman and television personality, Wilie Robertson is an author who has written and co-written several books based on his life and family.
