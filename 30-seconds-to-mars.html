And the same part goes on:</p><p>What if I wanted to fight<br>Beg for the rest of my life<br>What would you do?<br>You say you wanted more<br>What are you waiting for?<br>I'm not running from you</p><p>I think here Jared gives a voice to the part about to be killed, to express 2 opposite sides: on one hand, it begs in order to stay alive and on the other, it invites him to make the kill by saying to the real self that if he wants more, he shouldn't wait, it is not going to run.</p><p>Come break me down<br>Bury Me, bury me<br>I am finished with you<br>Look in my eyes<br>You're killing me, killing me<br>All I wanted was you</p><p>Again, the 2 sides of the part about to be killed in the previous verses: one inviting for the kill as if desiring it and the other begging for its life expressing the desire for him.</p><p>I tried to be someone else<br>But nothing seemed to change<br>I know now, this is who I really am inside.<br>Finally found myself<br>Fighting for a chance.<br>I know now, this is who I really am.</p><p>Finally, I think Jared reveals that the part of himself which has to end is really a part from another one inside of him, not allowing him to be himself. So, the real self explains to the part of the other inside him, which is about to be killed that he can have a chance only if he does this kill and this burial in order to be who he really is.</p><p>I think that in this song Jared sings about his conflict to be himself and through the voice of the part about to be killed expresses both his desire to kill the other but also his desire for the other to go on existing inside of him.</p><p>If we composed the lyrics and the video of the song, we would have more features for the interpretation of the song.</p><p>So, in the video they all go to a deserted hotel and they find a prohibition: not to enter a specific room. The room is entered only by Shannon, who finds a woman and kisses her, while at the same time images of her murdered appear. Tomo only looks inside from the outside of the room and witnesses a bear and himself in a stance insinuating that the bear just had his pinus in its mouth. Jared has nothing to do with the room. He only writes, while the other guy has a relationship with alcohol. Later on, Jared is chasing himself and the images of 2 selves appear for all 4 of them, as well as images of twins, brothers, sisters and couples.</p><p>I think the theme of the video is the relationship between males and females. This is what is hiding in the room. And in the video, we have 2 possibilities happening between them: either the woman is dead or the pinus is bitten by a wild animal. Between these possibilites, we could see a connection: the woman is dead in order to keep her from bitting the pinus. Jared seems to be away of the room, away from the relationship with the woman, resorting to writing and the narcissistic relationship to himself, as well as the 4th guy, who is related to alcohol instead.</p><p>The old guy could be the receptionist or the hotel owner and in this sense could represent the father and the woman of the video the mother. These 2 persons are the only ones in the hotel which the 4 of them visit. In this sense, the room could also represent the room of the mother and the father and the prohibition that exists for the children: they can't be part of the sexual relationship of the parents, and if they do in their phantasy, the danger of the bear exists.</p><p>If we return to the lyrics, we could say that Jared has a dialogue with 2 parts of himself as he puts it, his real self and another part, which has to do with the other, but doesn't let him be himself. He writes, putting his real self speaking to the part that needs to be buried that he can have a chance only if he does this kill and this burial in order for the real self to survive.</p><p>I think that the video explain more about what is killed. I think that the narcissistic end means that the part of the self that relates to the other, in this case the part of a man related to the woman, is buried, sacrificed in order for the self to survive and have a chance to go on in life.</p><p>I think, also, that the video could be more accurate regarding which part of Jared is singing which verses. I think this could be better adjusted to the dialogue between the 2 parts of Jared, coming to life in the song, as I see it.</p><p>I think this is a great song, expressing in every way (lyrics, music, video) deep conflicts in a very true, genuine and direct way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZmxoXaiypLvNnapmrJ9iuqK%2B0miroZ1doLatuA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brian-walsh-parents-who-are-brian-walsh-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brian Walsh Parents: Who Are Brian Walsh Parents?">&larr;
