Simpson divorced his first wife in 1979, clearing the way for his eventual wedding to Brown.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Simpson and Brown were married in February 1985 at his palatial home in the tony Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood.

She eschewed nannies, insisted on taking her children to dance and karate lessons, and welcomed family into her home for holiday events and birthday parties. Along with her familial duties, she started a small interior decorating business that only counted her husband and his friends as clients.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her marriage, however, was far from serene. Simpson wasn’t just unfaithful; he was abusive. Friends and relatives later recounted seeing bruises on Brown Simpson’s body, and police were called to their home multiple times. Among the numerous abusive incidents was a 1989 New Year’s Eve fight in which Simpson allegedly threatened to kill her and left her with a split lip, black eye, and other bruises. In the aftermath of that alarming night, he was charged with spousal battery and pleaded no contest. A judge sentenced him to 120 hours of community service, a $200 fine, a $500 donation to a domestic violence shelter for women, and two years’ probation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The couple then <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/18/us/simpson-case-marriage-handling-1989-wife-beating-case-was-terrible-joke.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="issued a statement" data-vars-ga-product-id=f1b11d47-cd1e-4938-b7eb-3179b1e1af8a data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/18/us/simpson-case-marriage-handling-1989-wife-beating-case-was-terrible-joke.html data-product-url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/18/us/simpson-case-marriage-handling-1989-wife-beating-case-was-terrible-joke.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F1994%2F06%2F18%2Fus%2Fsimpson-case-marriage-handling-1989-wife-beating-case-was-terrible-joke.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=d89795ec-4d0a-4407-93fa-4ae0bbc7d3eb class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">issued a statement</a>, saying, “Our marriage is as strong as the day we were married, if not stronger.” Simpson had also downplayed the events in an ESPN interview. “Hey, you know, we had a fight. We were both guilty. No one was hurt,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/06/24/nicole-and-oj-scenes-from-a-volatile-relationship/0ec96c2a-f916-4e35-b10d-5882b1cb43fa/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he said</a>. “It was no big deal—and we got on with our lives.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The facade finally collapsed in 1992. After years of enduring a volatile, abusive relationship and her husband’s extramarital philandering, Brown Simpson filed for divorce that February. The agreement was finalized on October 15, 1992.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Newly single and on her own, Brown relished her new life. Armed with a more than $430,000 settlement from her divorce and $10,000 a month in child support, she zipped around Brentwood in a white Ferrari and often went out dancing with friends, though she remained devoted to her kids.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, a seemingly paranoid Simpson was known to follow her, reportedly even hiding out in the bushes of her yard. “I’m scared,” Brown at one point told her mother. “I go to the gas station, he’s there. I’m driving, and he’s behind me.” The couple attempted to reconcile, though by late spring 1994, Brown told friends she was ending the on-again, off-again relationship.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 title=Death data-anchor-id=death class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the early morning hours of June 13, 1994, Brown Simpson and her friend, a 25-year-old waiter and model named <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/ron-goldman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ron Goldman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ron Goldman</a>, were found stabbed to death outside of her Brentwood condominium on South Bundy Drive in Los Angeles.
