In fact, they revealed that the actress was a great mother and nothing less.</p><p class=Fg>Judy Garland was one of the greatest actresses of her time, best known for her role as Dorothy in the classic film "The Wizard of Oz," for which she was highly regarded. By the age of 37, Garland had already made 39 movies and 500 radio shows.</p><p class=Fg>Her career was undoubtedly a whirlwind of success but was cut short when she was found dead in her home. Garland passed away from an accidental overdose of barbiturates at the age of 47, leaving behind her three children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a09336f3feeb9d4eae55ab154ed56ccb.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Judy Garland during her younger years and with her children Lorna and Joey in 1967. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>JUDY'S PERSONAL STRUGGLE</strong></p><p class=Fg>Judy had three children, Liza Minelli, Lorna Luft, and Joey Luft. Lorna, the second child, was only 16 when her mother succumbed to drug addiction. Her father, Sydney Luft, taught Lorna to change Garland's prescribed pills to sugar-filled ones at an early age.</p><p class=Fg>Her mother's life taught her what it was like to live under the tyranny of addiction. However, young as she was, Lorna understood why her mother became an addict. The pressure of the entertainment industry, the studio system, and the exhausting days of filming took a toll on the star.</p><p class=Fg>Lorna believes that had Garland been born later, she would have survived the addiction. During the '60s, there was a "stigma" and a lack of informative knowledge about substance abuse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/1551c56011c028f315817c50532e99689346411576714342.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Judy Garland at home answering fan mail circa 1944 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>"We have so much education about the world of addiction, and it's so prevalent in everybody's life right now, and the stigma has been taken off," she said in an interview, as <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7524505/Judy-Garlands-daughter-thinks-mother-survived-addiction-born-later.html>told</a> by Daily Mail.

Garland was a modern mom who cooked for and played with her kids during the late '50s throughout the early '60s.</p><p class=Fg>She spent all day working on set and came home exhausted. Nevertheless, she came home with a smile as she sang silly songs and laughed with her children before sleeping.

"When I call on her, she's there."</p><p class=Fg>Garland was a very cheerful, kind, incredibly loving person with a fun sense of humor.

Lorna, specifically, struggled to come to terms with her mom's death. Her mother's fame meant that the then-teenager had to grieve with Garland's many fans.</p><p class=Fg>It hurt because Lorna had to share her mom with everyone. In a previous interview, as told by Daily Mail, she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7524505/Judy-Garlands-daughter-thinks-mother-survived-addiction-born-later.html>said</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"It was bittersweet because I would comfort people, and they would go into their stories about how much they loved her, and I thought, 'When is my time to say she's your icon, she's your legend, she's my mom?'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/3ed9a8c843bbc09a97d5fa35132bcd36.jpeg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Judy Garland in an airport, circa 1955. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>DEPENDENCE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE</strong></p><p class=Fg>Despite having seen her mother deal with substance abuse, Lorna also had her time of using cocaine. She thought she had no problems like her mother did because she only used it at night or during parties. It was the time of Studio 54 and all of that, so it seemed normal.</p><p class=Fg>One day someone approached Lorna and told her that what she was doing was the same as her mother. Although she initially denied it, she eventually went to rehabilitation because she wanted to have a baby, and frankly, she was exhausted of feeling tired and sick.</p><p class=Fg>Fortunately, she succeeded and has been able to carve out a career as a singer, running out living in the shadow of her famous mother.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>GARLAND'S BIOPIC</strong></p><p class=Fg>In recent years, a blockbuster <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7506943/Judy-Garlands-daughter-Lorna-Luft-says-WONT-watch-new-Renee-Zelleweger-film.html>biopic</a> about Garland's life was released. However, Lorna claimed she had no intention of watching the production of her mother's troubled years. Lorna is protective of her mother's legacy and Hollywood career, and recommends people to watch her films and shows instead.</p><p class=Fg>Similarly, Minelli did not plan to watch the Oscar-nominated film. Instead, she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a30809668/liza-minnelli-judy-garland-renee-zellweger-movie-quote/>wished</a> the actress who played her mother, Renee Zellweger, a great time while filming. Minelli, who also lived in her mom's shadow, became an actress.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>GARLAND BEHIND THE SCREEN</strong></p><p class=Fg>Born Frances Ethel Gumm on June 10, 1922, <a class="Xd a" href=#>Garland</a> was the youngest daughter of Ethel Marion and Francis Gumm. She was a child star, performing by the age of four, and grew up loved by many. However, her struggles behind the scenes, including being forced to starve herself as a teen, were no secret.</p><p class=Fg>In her biopic, "Judy," it was revealed that her management, MGM, used drugs such as "pep pills" or amphetamines and "downers" such as barbiturates to modulate their talents. Aside from her life on set, Garland also had a series of unfortunate love stories.</p><p class=Fg>She was married five times, with her first wedding at the age of 19 to David Rose. In 1945, she married director Vincent Minelli, followed by Sidney Luft in the '50s. In 1965, she tied the knot with Mark Herron and later wed Mickey Deans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0f265ae0a32862bb0b4c17764a23dad6.jpeg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Judy Garland and her husband to be Mickey Deans at home on the morning of their wedding at Chelsea Register Office in London on 15th March 1969. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>Garland was perceived from different lenses with a series of ups and downs in her life. To her daughter, however, she was just exhausted from everything.

"I think she just got tired.
