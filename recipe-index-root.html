And the best part about it is that you don’t actually have to make said sandwich on the day you’re planning to eat it. Nope, this breakfast sandwich recipe freezes perfectly, so you can assemble a week’s worth of sandwiches on the weekend and feast on them all week. If you ask me, it’s one of the nicest things you can do for your future self.

But unlike a pie, which requires hours of chilling and baking and cooling, this cinnamon apples recipe is ready in under 30 minutes. I love its simplicity. Its lack of crust, batter, or crumble topping allows it to be just as at home at breakfast as it is at dessert. It also means that this recipe is 100% about the apples. If you have a craving for cozy, apple-y fall flavor, there’s no easier or more satisfying way to indulge it than…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This peanut butter banana smoothie is the kind of breakfast that makes you excited to get out of bed in the morning. It calls for 4 simple ingredients, it takes minutes to make, and it tastes so good that it could almost pass as dessert. The peanut butter, banana, and whole rolled oats make it thick and creamy, and they infuse it with the BEST sweet and nutty flavor. They also happen to add fiber, protein, potassium, and vitamin C, meaning that this delicious breakfast is a healthy one too. I think you’ll love it!

After a summer filled with picnic leftovers and impromptu farmers market meals, I’m trying to get back in the rhythm of doing at least a little meal prep at the start of the week. That way, at lunchtime, I’m not totally stumped by what to eat. Luckily, this lentil salad recipe is simple to make, so it’s a breeze to put together on a Sunday. It also tastes so good that I don’t mind eating it for a few days on repeat. I douse al dente lentils,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s the perfect time of year to make corn chowder. Summer veggies like sweet corn and peppers still abound at the farmers market and grocery store, but as the sun sets earlier and the temperatures cool, a comforting bowl of soup can really hit the spot. This corn chowder recipe is everything I’m craving right now. A meal in a bowl, it’s filled with chunky potatoes, corn kernels, red peppers, and a lightly creamy broth that’s bursting with sweet corn flavor. To balance the sweetness, I throw in savory celery and a dash of Old Bay Seasoning, smoked paprika, and…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you’re looking for an easy appetizer to bring to a party or BBQ this weekend, this corn dip is exactly what you need. It’s super simple to make, and, like all the best picnic and cookout recipes, it actually gets better if you make it ahead. …which is really saying something, because this corn dip is insanely delicious to begin with. A creamy, tangy combo of mayo and Greek yogurt coats juicy, smoky grilled corn kernels, jalapeños, and green onions. Lime juice makes it fresh and bright, and big drizzles of hot sauce add an extra kick. Yum, right?!…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This post is in partnership with&nbsp;Jewel-Osco®. Happy September! Fall may not officially start until the 22nd, but I’m already excited for warming soups, comforting pastas, and cozy baked goods like these cinnamon apple scones. These cute little treats are everything I crave on a crisp fall morning. They’re lightly sweet, moist, and warmly spiced, with a delicious apple-y flavor that pairs perfectly with a steaming cup of coffee or tea. They’re easy to make, and I love that all the ingredients are available at the Jewel-Osco® just down the street from our house.

Mounds of eggplants, tomatoes, and multicolored peppers fill every stall. I’m pretty pleased about it, because this Sicilian vegetable stew is one of my favorite late summer dishes. It’s tangy, briny, and lightly sweet, with a rich, silky texture that’s absolutely irresistible. I first fell in love with caponata years ago on a trip to Italy. Jack and I ordered it as an appetizer with crusty bread and a glass of white wine almost everywhere we went. When we got home, of course I had to learn…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you ask me, everyone should learn how to make crostini. These little Italian toasts are at home at any party or gathering, and they’re an absolute breeze to make. Thinly slice a baguette, brush the slices with olive oil, and toast them in the oven until they’re crisp and golden. Once they’re toasted, they’re the perfect base for all kinds of toppings. Creamy spreads, fresh veggies, herbs, fruit, or cheese… You’ll find over 10 crostini recipes in our recipe index and another 4 in my cookbooks. What can I say? The crostini topping possibilities are endless! How to Make…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I’m finally coming around to roasted zucchini. You’d think, given how much I love pretty much all zucchini recipes, that I would have been a fan of it forever. But no. Roasted zucchini and I got off to a rocky start. See, I have a strong aversion to anything mushy. Before I worked out this game-changing recipe, that’s how my roasted zucchini always ended up. It was too soft and too watery, basically mush. But this summer, I decided to give roasted zucchini another chance. Instead of slicing the squash into thin rounds like I had in the past, I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Italian seasoning is one of those kitchen basics, like bread crumbs or a simple vinaigrette, that I prefer to make at home instead of buying at the store. I keep all the ingredients in my pantry anyway. I may as well combine them myself instead of picking up an extra spice! More importantly, making my own Italian seasoning allows me to control the balance of flavors. My homemade blend has a mix of sweet, earthy, and aromatic notes that I absolutely love. I’ve shared my favorite Italian seasoning recipe below.
