He has a permanent double vision.</p><p>Double vision is a phenomenon where a person sees two different images of one object. The prism glasses help join the two images into one image.</p><p>Zak wears cool prism glasses. One of his regular glasses is from&nbsp;Oakley.</p><p>Zachary Alexandar Bagans is an American paranormal investigator, television character, actor, museum operator, and lastly, author. He lives in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>Bagans was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. He graduated from Glenbard West High School.</p><p>The paranormal activist is the dominant host of the&nbsp;Travel Channel&nbsp;series Ghost Adventures.</p><p>Recently, in 2021 the ghost investigator linked himself with the top-rated TV network, Discovery+.</p><p>The Ghost Adventures premiered on Travel Channel originally as a series in 2008 and now moved to Discovery+.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-zak-bagans-eyes></span>What Happened To Zak Bagans Eyes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zak Bagans eyes have a condition called double vision or diplopia. It is not an inborn condition but something that developed later.</p><p>Diplopia is the medical term for double vision or seeing double. It is not a serious condition, but regular follow-up is suggested.</p><p>When a person sees two images of a single object, then it may be considered as double vision.</p><p>Normally, the eyes, the muscles moving them, the nerves that transport pictures to the brain, and the brain all have to work simultaneously. Any difficulty with any of these parts can result in double vision.</p><p>Such a condition can affect one eye (monocular)or both eyes (binocular). It can be horizontal (images appearing side by side) or vertical (images appearing above the other).</p><figure></figure><p>Monocular is less common and is usually caused by dry eyes, astigmatism, and cataracts. On the other hand, binoculars are generally a symptom of squint and are caused by eye muscles or nerve disorders.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-has-he-had-double-vision></span>How long has he had double-vision?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Zak was not born with it but developed it after filming one of the Demon House documentaries.</p><p>According to Bagans’ tweet of 2019, he confirms having permanent double-vision. He wears prism glasses every day as a protector.</p><p>As stated by the&nbsp;Best of Las Vegas&nbsp;article, the ghost hunter developed this condition in a Gary, Indiana House. The house was home to 200 demons as claimed by visionaries.</p><figure></figure><p>The paranormal investigator bought the residence without even visiting, over the telephone. He spent his time locked inside the house hunting ghosts.</p><p>Since that day, his eyes began crossing. He visited four doctors, but none could explain the rapid outbreak of his vision problems.</p><p>He wishes for an operation, but after finding that he may go blind, he decided to stick with prism glasses for the rest of his life.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=treatments-for-double-vision></span>Treatments for double-vision<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Depending upon the cause of the double vision, Optometrists may suggest one or more following treatments;</p><ul><li>Barring the vision of one eye using an eye patch, occlusive lens, or prism glasses</li><li>Injecting botulinum toxin</li><li>Surgery</li><li>Treating other medical conditions</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zak-wears-cool-prism-glasses></span>Zak Wears Cool Prism Glasses<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zak Bagans wears prism glasses to help with his double vision. They look the same as any regular study glasses or other.</p><p>His regular glasses are from Oakley.</p><figure></figure><p>Prism glasses are doctor-recommended eyeglasses having special lenses for rectifying double vision. Sometimes recommended for eye strains also.</p><p>Normally prescribed lenses rectify visual clarity for errors like myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism. On the contrary, Prism lenses correct eye adjustment or movement problems and not refractive issues.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-it-work></span>How does it work?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A prism fitted to eyeglasses bends light before it proceeds through the eye. The light is then altered to the correct spot on the retina in each eye.</p><p>The brain then combines the two images jointly to generate one clear image.</p><p>Prism glasses for long-term use can be attached to the lens or lenses of a person’s glass. For a short-term prism correction, the Fresnel prism is recommended.</p><p>Such glasses may fix the double vision from eye misalignment when caused by:</p><ul><li>Eye muscle problem</li><li>Neurological (brain-related) issues</li><li>Nerve-related difficulty</li></ul><p>The host of paranormal shows has been using prism eyeglasses since 2018.&nbsp; It was the day he documented his film ‘Demon House’ in a Gary, Indiana house.</p><p>Prism glasses are available on&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;based on the alignment of the double vision.</p><p>Some stylish with different varieties of prism glasses are also available on&nbsp;Warby Parker.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-host-hasnt-changed-his-style-in-a-while></span>The Host Hasn’t Changed His Style In A While<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Ghost Adventures host has a basic&nbsp;sense of fashion. As can be seen from his Instagram, Bagans mostly dresses in dark-colored clothes with dark prism glasses.</p><p>He likes to appear usually in a gothic look with clothes without bright colors. Graphic tees, with dark pants, jackets, shoes, and hats are the symbol of goth.</p><figure></figure><p>His dressing sense represents a type of fashion that shows a dark attitude and viewpoint toward life. The fashion sense remains the same throughout with few modifications such as no cap or dark jacket with some graphics.</p><p>Attires and wearables based on the host are available on different online shopping websites such as&nbsp;Hats, and&nbsp;Zak Bagans merch.</p><p>His team Aaron Goodwin, Billy Tolley, and Jay Wasley are all dressed in the same manner. The whole team prefers dark colors.</p><p>The dressing sense of the 45 years old ghost hunter is questioned quite often.</p><p>Bagans answers such questions in a practical way. The job of a ghost hunter requires him to work at any time of the week, usually the whole night.</p><p>While locked up in the room at night with lights off in particular and as a ghost investigator in general bright colored clothes gives a contrast look.</p><figure></figure><p>Moreover, bright-colored clothes do not match the surrounding or the purpose of the show. When we picture a paranormal investigator, we usually don’t visualize a person with a bright checked shirt, denim, and a pair of white sneakers.</p><p>Therefore, the look that the Ghost Adventurer team shares is justified and perfectly matches the theme of the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaLKRoHqjrcaapaxlla6ytHnRnqiuoaKaeqm1zGarqGWnmq6zec%2BroKylXZy5or%2FSnqpo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./adrienne-bailon-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adrienne Bailon net worth: A Breakdown of Her Income Sources and Expenses">&larr;
