Now that I have a place where I can be free to be all of me and taking reign of my 30's, I'm super excited to be able to express myself in ways that I haven't been able to over the last 10 years."</p><p>Kathryn added: "I feel like I am finally discovering myself again and am excited to share the journey with you, wings grow strong once the cage is gone."</p><p>The controversial star is not thought to be posing naked on the site, at least for now, as she's merely sharing modeling photos and content from her travels.</p><p>One revealing post teases her fans with the caption: "From behind on rare occasions," with a wink emoji, while another showcases her as both a blonde and a redhead.</p><p>Kathryn, who comes from a wealthy family, was known for blowing through her inheritance on the show, often splashing out on expensive rental homes and luxury cars.</p><p>She has also forked out thousands on legal fees during her <a href=#>lengthy custody battle</a> with her ex over <a href=#>their two young children</a>, St. Julien Rembert, 7, and daughter Kensington Calhoun, 8.</p><p>More recently, <a href=#>she has faced eviction</a> at apartments across Charleston, as she struggles to pay her bills.</p><p>She was hit with two Rule to Vacate notices this year for her WestEdge apartment she once shared with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ex-boyfriend Chleb Ravenell</a>.</p><p>Kathryn was served with a Rule to Vacate notice for “non-payment of rent” on November 17, 2022 by her new complex, East Bay Apartments.</p><p>She has yet to respond to the complaint, according to Charleston, South Carolina court records.&nbsp;</p><h2>BAD REPUTATION</h2><p><a href=#>The U.S. Sun</a> also exclusively revealed&nbsp;<a href=#>Kathryn</a> was not offered a new full-time contract for the next season of Southern Charm because of multiple "no-shows" and for treating staff poorly.</p><p>Bravo is yet to comment on her departure from Southern Charm, but Deadline claimed recently she may still have a cameo in the latest series.</p><p>Instagram account&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@queensofbravo</a>&nbsp;first reported the rumor, although now a source close to&nbsp;<a href=#>Southern Charm</a>&nbsp;production confirmed the&nbsp;<a href=#>Bravo</a>&nbsp;star has been fired.</p><p>The insider shared: "I know Bravo didn't offer her a contract, but when you treat people poorly like she has they finally get sick of it.</p><p>"She doesn’t show up on time or show up at all during filming a lot."</p><p>The source continued: "She treats people like they are beneath her. She can't stand anyone doing better or getting more attention than her."</p><p>The insider shared Kathryn treated staff on the show and the cast members poorly and would often throw tantrums on set.</p><p>“I think that’s why a new producer was brought in; the previous one couldn't handle it anymore," the source commented.</p><p>The source shared the new producer has been hired, although the producer's full name has not yet been released to the public.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The Southern Charm insider concluded: "I&nbsp;know she’s had money issues and now I don’t know how she’s going to work, she’s never had a job.</p><p>"I’m worried for her, but maybe this is a wake-up call."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/permission-j-michael-walker-kathryns-672159149.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/kathryn-dennis-photo-charles-sykes-751708198-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/southern-charms-kathryn-dennis-near-731346680.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYWx9dIKWaKqoraSdsrO6jJyfmqqdYriiwMersKdllJq7r7XSZp2aoZxivK%2B42J%2BYp6tdmK6zscSrZJ%2BhopqxcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-are-tommy-lee-parents-pam-and-tommy-explores-the-heritage-and-race-of-the-singer-217639-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Tommy Lee Parents?
