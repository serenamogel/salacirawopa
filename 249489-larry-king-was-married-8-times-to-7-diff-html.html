Here is a glimpse into his relationships over the years.</p><p class=dh>The late Larry King, who passed away on January 23, was a man who lived a robust, full, and impactful life. This greatly extended to his love life as well.</p><p class=dh>After decades of dominating his place in television and 87, the legendary man <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.closerweekly.com/posts/larry-kings-ex-wives-details-about-the-tv-stars-marriages/>was married eight times</a> to seven different wives. Please take<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/larry-king-wives-and-marriages-a-history/> a look </a>at his relationship timeline.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/75b3b4851a6f24161598ef5c9776f815.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Larry King at the Starmus Festival on June 21, 2017 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>FREDA MILLER: 1952-1953</strong></p><p class=dh>As many do, King began his love life with his high school sweetheart. At 18, he exchanged vows with his young lover, Freda Miller. However, their parents were allegedly not pleased with the new marital development and had the marriage annulled the following year.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ANNETTE KAYE: 1961</strong></p><p class=dh>In yet another eventful marital stint, the Late Larry King found love once again in the arms of Annette Kaye in 1961. Although the marriage did not last for up to a year, the former couple welcomed King’s first child, Larry Jr., that same year.</p><p class=dh>King reportedly did not meet Larry Jr. until he was in his 30s. According to reports, Kaye gave birth to their son after they already parted ways.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ALENE AKINS: 1961-1963</strong></p><p class=dh>Not a man to waste time brooding, King went on to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/larry-kings-7-ex-wives-divorce>tie the knot</a> with the third of his seven wives, former Playboy Bunny, Alene Akins; they would get married again later in the future. He adopted Akins’ son, Andy, during their first marriage.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MICKEY SUTPHIN: 1964 - 1967</strong></p><p class=dh>Still, a man to find love quickly, King moved on shortly after his 1963 divorce with Akins, and a year after, he said “I do” to Mickey Sutphin, with whom he had a daughter, Kelly. Two years after they were married, she divorced him.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ALENE AKINS: 1968-1971</strong></p><p class=dh>Ever a man of compassion, King reignited his love with his third wife, Akins. During their second marriage, they welcomed their daughter, Chaia. Sadly, both Chaia and Akins’ son, Andy, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/larry-kings-wild-love-life-23372303>reportedly died within 23 days</a> of each other in 2020.</p><p class=dh>In late July 2020, Andy passed away at 65, reportedly after he suddenly suffered a heart attack. Weeks later, Chaia passed away after battling lung cancer at the age of 52. King <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="http://www.facebook.com/81154649664/posts/10159177735069665/?d=n">mourned them publicly</a> on Facebook, reflecting on how great they were.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>SHARON LEPORE: 1976-1983</strong></p><p class=dh>Unlike his habit of quickly falling in love, the television legend had five years between his second marriage to Akins and his next marriage.</p><p class=dh>In 1976, he married production assistant and teacher Sharon Lepore. However, eternity with wife number five was not in the cards, and they got divorced in 1983.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/33567b63a51bb2f15ea1aaca1de04ecd.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Larry King and Sharon Lepore at Academy of Music's Norman Pattiz Concert Hall Dedication on Feb 21, 1989 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>JULIE ALEXANDER: 1989-1992</strong></p><p class=dh>Come ‘89; Julie Alexander <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2021/01/03/who-is-larry-kings-wife-heres-a-look-at-his-eight-marriages/>captured the heart</a> of King. She became the sixth of King’s seven wives after they exchanged vows in Washington. By 1990, asunder had been put between the two love birds, and they separated, only finally divorcing in 1992.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>SHAWN SOUTHWICK: 1997-2019</strong></p><p class=dh>On September 5, 1997, <a class="me a" href=#>King </a>married his seventh and longest-standing wife, former singer and TV host Shawn Southwick. They had two sons, Cannon and Chance. After decades of a matrimonial union, King filed for divorce in August 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0c590b777fb406607a6a45c1015ce917.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Larry King and Shawn King at The Brent Shapiro Foundation Summer Spectacular on September 7, 2018 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>He cited irreconcilable differences for the reason for the divorce. Theirs was a marriage filled with ups and downs, including many infidelity rumors on both sides plaguing their marriage.</p><p class=dh>In all, the talk show legend was a grandfather to nine grandkids and a great-grandfather to four great-grandchildren due to his many marriages. Larry King would be greatly missed, a man with many great admirable qualities and a heart easy to love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtrcmxobnqtrdGrsGajmaO0bsPArGSmmaKntqawjHFkraGdmsBuwM5mbmacmZuzb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./multi-platinum-selling-rock-superstars-incubus-set-summer-2022-tour.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Multi-Platinum Selling Rock Superstars Incubus Set Summer 2022 Tour">&larr;
