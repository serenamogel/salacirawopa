Then she released ‘Every Day in Between,’ her second single, but only in English.</p><p>These two songs earned her the title of “pop singer,” but she realized that singing was not for her, so she moved to Los Angeles and tried her hand at acting.

However, she encountered difficulties in her early days in Hollywood due to her surname ‘Wang,’ which is Asian, so she changed it to Bennet, which was her father’s first name.</p><h2>Chloe Bennet Achievements and Awards</h2><p>It hasn’t been long since Chloe arrived in Hollywood, and while she has undoubtedly impressed the public, she has yet to win any awards or achieve significant success, aside from a nomination for the Kids’ Choice Award.</p><h2>Chloe Bennet’s Net Worth in 2023</h2><p>Having success in two different fields, singing, and acting, is never easy, but Chloe Bennet has done it.
