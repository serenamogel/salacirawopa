He nonetheless had a lot of colored friends in the music industry.</p><p>His accomplishments weren’t evident initially, but his love for music and consistency over time has made him the star he is today. His breakout single, Nkalakatha, was a modernized version of the late kwaito star Mandoza’s mega-hit single of the same name, released in 2000.</p><p>Costa Titch comes from the town of Nelspruit in the province of Mpumalanga in South Africa. He realized at a young age that he had an interest in the entertainment industry, and he made the decision to begin a career as a dancer. After that, in 2014, he relocated to Johannesburg, where he has been since and has continued to hone his rapping abilities.</p><p>More info on: <a href=#>Sarah Huckabee Accident – Was She In A Hit And Run?
